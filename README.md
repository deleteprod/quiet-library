# quiet-library
Holding place for lots of little code examples - building blocks for things I will forget I ever once knew. Saves me Googling the Bejesus out of Stackoverflow.
I had initially envisaged this as being just for Python only, though I think in fact I will end up dumping here stuff on Docker, Ansible, Terraform, Bash, basically
all of the things I run off and learn once, then don't get much chance to use for a while so may end up forgetting and having to re-learn. I also have in this repo
a bunch of the "Things I always wanted to get round to doing, but never have had the time", so those will sit there in the respective TODO folders to be chipped
away at as and when I get time.
